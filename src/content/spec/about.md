Welcome to ZeStig's online lair!
# Profile
I am a hardworking student with an eye for up-and-coming technologies. I’ve had a keen interest in <ins>stargazing</ins> and **Astrophysics** from a young age, having voraciously read books on the subject. I’ve been an analyst and problem-solver for as long as I can remember.

# Projects
## StratOS
I am working on a GNU+Linux distribution called StratOS. My team and I have also developed several tools related to the project: 
- **[Rock (package manager)](https://github.com/StratOS-Linux/rock)**
  - It provides a unified interface for pulling packages from multiple sources. 
  - Designed with new Linux users in mind, it aims to accustom the user to a slick interface from where they can install packages.
  - Supports `apt`, `pacman` and `flatpak` as well as AUR packages

- **[StratOS](https://github.com/StratOS-Linux/StratOS-iso)**
  - co-maintainer of the GNOME edition of StratOS - the *flagship* edition
  - ISOs are built via GitHub Actions
  - includes lightweight shell extensions to improve UI/UX.
  - Custom kernel support is on the roadmap
  
- **[StratOS-Hyprland](https://github.com/zstg/StratOS-Hyprland)**
  - sole maintainer of the Hyprland spin of StratOS.
  - Added a cheat-sheet for beginners
  - Designed to be aesthetic and user-friendly
  - Provides twice the looks at half the performance
  
- **[StratOS-repo](https://github.com/StratOS-Linux/StratOS-repo)**  
  - package repository for StratOS
  - builds are automated via [Docker](https://docker.io) 
  - Packages are configured to release weekly
  
- **[Grab](https://github.com/StratOS-Linux/grab)**
  - Smart system information script that caches redundant details
  - Very lightweight and fast (multiple times faster than competitors)
  - Memory-safe - Written in Rust
  - Very useful for diagnosing hardware issues
  
  
# Skills
## Linux
I’m a passionate FOSS user and a virtuoso who loves meddling around with the internals on my Arch Linux setup. I have an eye for software such as GNU Emacs and Window Managers. 
## Rust
I’ve used Rust extensively for projects and have started embedded programming in Rust - on microcontrollers such as the Raspberry Pi and Arduino Uno.
## Python 
I’ve used Python for data science and machine learning projects. I’ve built a simple meta-search engine in Python, designed primarily as a means for me to learn some backend development.

# Clubs and Activities

### Coding Conundrums Community 
I’ve founded this community to tackle puzzles programmatically using data structure concepts. Inspired in part by https://github.com/TheAlgorithms, our community works on simple and effective solutions to Mensa-type puzzles using common data structures. 
### Technical Advisory, Linux User Group VITC 
My passion for Linux and FOSS led me to the Linux club. I harnessed my passion to the fullest, participating in and offering technical support for the various hackathons that the club conducted. Cyber-0-Day ‘23 was my first tryst with cybersecurity, experiencing new and intriguing technologies such as Metasploit and Kali NetHunter. 
### IEEE Photonics, VIT Chennai 
Contributed to IEEE Photonics team projects.
